## Arrays coding challenge
> Create a program using arrays, that sorts a list of `integers`, in `descending order`. The `array` should consist of randomly generated `integers`
> Remember to print the array before you sort it.

## Example
```Java
  Input: arr = [50, 25, 80, 5, 15]
  Output: [80, 50, 25, 15, 5]
```
