## Arrays coding challenge
> Write a method called `readIntegers`, that reads a comma delimited list of numbers,
> entered by the user from the console, and then returns an `array`, containing those numbers that were entered.
> Next, write a method called `findMin` that takes the array as an argument, and returns the `minimum value` found in that `array`

## Example
```Java
  Input: arr = 50, 25, 80, 5, 15
  Output: 5
```
